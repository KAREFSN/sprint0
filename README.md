## SPRINT0

### Getting Started

At this point of the individual task, my repository (sprint0) contains the README.md file originally created when the repository was created, 3 files from chapters 1,3 and 5 from the textbook "Pro Git"  _( first, second and third respectively)_ .
By the end of this individual task of the sprint, there should be another file titled "AllMyCommands.txt" that contains all the commands I have used for this sprint.
